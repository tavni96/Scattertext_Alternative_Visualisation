brave to reward companies that ship jobs overseas while cutting education here at home?and is it courageous to raise taxes on middle- class families while giving tax cuts to people with swiss bank accounts?look, mitt romney's and paul ryan's obsession with tax breaks for the wealthy is <font color=\"#F39C12\"><strong >part</strong></font> of a rigid ideology: give people like mitt romney a
